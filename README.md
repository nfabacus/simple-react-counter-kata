# Simple React Counter Kata

This is purely for me to practice building simple react components.

Practice below:
```
- Set up a html page with links to react and babel.
- Make simple react components.
- Render the components into a html page.
- Set default props.
- Use props.
- Set initial state.
- Use and change state.
- Pass on props to child component(s).
- Use state.
- Add a click function to a button to increment a number by one.
```
